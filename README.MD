**PROJECT TITLE:** Sorting Algorithms Performance\
**PURPOSE OF PROJECT:** Learned how the sorting algorithms - BubbleSort, InsertionSort, MergeSort, SelectionSort, QuickSort -compare with their performance.\
**VERSION or DATE:** v1.3\
**HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:** Require BlueJ or any IDE that supports Java\
**AUTHORS:** Shakh Saidov and Ali Sultan\
**USER INSTRUCTIONS:**
- Have a file "Test1Input.txt" with an unsorted list of 1 data type of any reasonable length.
- Run main() from Main.java and have the file sorted using 6 different sorting algorithms.
- Run ExperimentController.java to see the runtimes of specified algorithms, changing the sample size as needed.
