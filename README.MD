PROJECT TITLE: Sorting Algorithms Performance
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Study how the theoretical analysis of a variety of sorting algorithms compares
with their actual performance.
VERSION or DATE: v1.3
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Require BlueJ or any IDE that supports Java
AUTHORS: Shakh Saidov and Ali Sultan
USER INSTRUCTIONS: 
- Have a file "Test1Input.txt" with an unsorted list of 1 data type of any reasonable length. 
- Run main() from Main.java and have the file sorted using 6 different sorting algorithms.
- Run ExperimentController.java to see the runtimes of specified algorithms, changing the sample size as needed.
